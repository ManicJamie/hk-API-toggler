You may have seen my terrible assortment of batch files for apiswitching. Those are bad. This is better. use this.

Uber-lightweight forms app that actually:
- does not need to be in the same folder as hollow_knight.exe
- remembers where your hollow knight folder is
- checks whether the dll actually exists (incredible feature, i know)
- tells you whether your game is already modded (ya big dummy)
- doesn't overwrite the dll if it's already the type you're trying to switch to (somehow a feature)
